# ArrayUnorderedandOrderedList
Array Implementation of Ordered List and Unordered List.

Developed in order to see the O(n) differences between the two, and the other repository including the Linked List modification. All code based off the abstraction of PriorityQueue<E>. Furthermore, included Comparable<E> in order to allow subtraction based on Generics. File does not exist on project since Professor made the code for it within the abstracted file.
